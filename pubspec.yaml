  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.
  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: CeraRoundPro
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/CeraRoundPro-DEMO/CeraRoundProDEMO-Regular.otf
        - asset: assets/fonts/CeraRoundPro-DEMO/CeraRoundProDEMO-Black.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/CeraRoundPro-DEMO/CeraRoundProDEMO-Bold.ttf
